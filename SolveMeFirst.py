#Problem Statement:
#Complete the function solveMeFirst to compute the sum of two integers.


def solveMeFirst(a, b):
    return a + b

num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())
res = solveMeFirst(num1, num2)
print(res)


#Logic:
#This code takes two numbers from the user, adds them together, and then displays the result. It uses a simple function, solveMeFirst, to perform the addition.
